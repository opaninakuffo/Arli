## Who is Arli?

![Arli](https://i.ibb.co/Db04CpR/Arli.png)

Arli is a 3-axis robotic arm used to mimic actions on a factory production line:
- It is capable of picking objects based on color and proximity from a conveyor belt to specific places and vice-versa.
- It has both manual and automatic control 

To bring Arli to life, the team used Solidworks (CAD) to design parts of the arm and conveyor belt, 
Arduino and C/C++ programming to code the activities that it performs, and 
electronic circuit components such as 4 servo motors, 1 stepper motor and driver, potentiometers, color sensors, and push buttons.

Arli was programmed by Opanin Akuffo, and designed and built by Denver Chikokonya, Nadine Iradukunda, and Joe Amarteifio.
